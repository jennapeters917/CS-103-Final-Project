	<p>What do a Math (and Econ) major, CS Major, and Graphic Design Major have in common?
	Academically speaking, there isn't much overlap. We all have our own academic paths, whether we 
	are only beginning or nearing the end. Come explore our portfolios, and see what academic diversity
	we have to offer. Each page is dedicated to one portfolio for the three of us. We encourage 
	you to explore them all, but also understand if you would like to avoid the Math major's portfolio. </p>

		<h2>The Graphic Design Major: Alexandra</h2>

		<p>Jenna Peters is a Junior at Boston University and Pursuing a degree in Economics
		and Mathematics as well as a minor in Computer Science. When she isn't ridiculously busy
		with her ridiculous major she works as a Course Assistant for Introduction to Computer Science (CS 111).
		She hopes to one day work for the Federal Reserve, because the whole point of her ridiculous major
		is to one day be an Economist. Visit her page to read musings about Math and Economics, and maybe
		even see a bit of code...</p>
