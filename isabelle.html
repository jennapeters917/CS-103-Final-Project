			<p> The radical change from being an international relations major to a computer science major has definitely sent me on the biggest ride of 
				my life thus far. Going from thinking about diplomacy and writing essays, to working on problem sets until late at night.
				I don't mind it though, and I've definitely fallen iin love with it as time has passed, despite how difficult it all is. 
			<br><br>
			Nowadays, I have other interests meant to keep me afloat. I still keep in touch with my creative and active sides to keep a wide variety of interests.
		For example, I've been a barista for over two years and am heavily invested in coffee culture, as it's been the best experience I've had. Additionally,
		I enjoy working on web3 development and building decentralized apps using ReactJS and Solidity meant for Ethereum smart contracts. </p>

		<h4>The Transition to where I am now. </h4>
		<p> After a lot of thinking throughout the summer, I knew that international relations was not where I ultimately wanted to end up, and my interests
			led me to discovering the complex and fascinating world of computer science, and through several ups and downs, I couldn't be happier. </p>

		<p>My decision to switch majors definitely raised a lot of eyebrows from both people in the IR field and CS field. Even now, one of my constant worries is:
			Can I do this? Am I capable? However, despite all of these doubts - I ultimately recognise the big leap I made, and my perserverance through it. </p>

		<p>Though most my time nowadays is spent coding and learning about more of the intricacies of programming, I still need to take time to myself,
		to have an opportunity for self-reflection in an external setting. A while ago, I became a barista for the experience of learning all about
		craft coffee and its exquisite taste. Fast forward two years or so, I now have a significant amount of experience that allows me to show
		and train others on the skill of making craft coffee and excellent service. </p>

		<h4>Working out</h4>
		<p> A hobby I've discovered over the past 6 months has been that of spin classes. A nice, 45/60 minute invigorating workout that gives every
			rider an opportunity to push themselves to their limits inside a dark, candlelit room where the only focus is yourself and the task
			at hand. It was in this room where I began to realise that I needed to stop being afraid of change, and go ahead and make the leap into
			a new field.</p>

		<h4>My Love-Hate Relationship with Coding</h4>
		<p>Coding is not only something I study, but it has also become my job, and now my 
		hobby. I am currently in two CS classes and I am a CA for another. Coding has begin to 
		bleed into my dreams. I wake up in the middle of the night because my mind started to code. 
		I have nightmares of null-pointer exceptions. Despite all this, I really do 
		like to code.</p>

		
		
		<img src = "images/code.png" alt = "block of code">
		<p class = "img-caption">An algorithm written by Jenna.</p>
		<p> This block of code is a triumph and defeat for me. I spent a long time
		designing and tweaking this algorithm. But I was so relieved when It worked. The algorithm creates a 
		two clusters of points about two lines, which you can specify the slope and intercept for. I wrote it for my CS 506 class. Apparently we
		could just use a method from the NumPy library, but I wrote this before I knew. While Im upset by the lost time,
		I'm proud I could write an algorithm on my own.

		<h4>What progress have I made in a year?</h4>
		<p>A bit over a year ago I began CS 111 and coded for the first time in my life. Since then
		I have been constantly entrenched in coding. My best language by far is Python, which 
		is common among most Computer Science students at Boston University. My next best would be Java, but its not
		a language I spend much time with. The purpose of this minor is so that I have the coding skills
		to do economic research, and Python is the one of best languages to do any sort of math, modeling, or
		visualizations. Java is object-oriented, I don't do much object oriented programming. I know a bit of R.
		I can use Stata, but I have a hate-only relationship with it as Python can do everything stata does, and it has horrible
		documentation.</p>
